       "AIMessage(content='Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the management of type 2 diabetes. While it is generally well-tolerated, like any medication, it can have potential side effects. Here are some of the commonly reported side effects of metformin:\\n\\n1. Gastrointestinal issues: The most common side effects of metformin involve the gastrointestinal system. These may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and a metallic taste in the mouth. These symptoms are usually mild and tend to improve over time.\\n\\n2. Hypoglycemia: Metformin alone does not typically cause low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia). However, when used in combination with other diabetes medications like insulin or sulfonylureas, it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.\\n\\n3. Lactic acidosis: Although rare, lactic acidosis is a serious side effect associated with metformin. It is characterized by the buildup of lactic acid in the blood, leading to symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, and abdominal discomfort. Lactic acidosis is more likely to occur in individuals with kidney or liver problems, alcohol abuse, or severe infections.\\n\\n4. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Long-term use of metformin has been associated with decreased levels of vitamin B12 in the body. This deficiency can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, numbness or tingling in the extremities, and cognitive impairment. Regular monitoring of vitamin B12 levels and supplementation may be necessary for some individuals.\\n\\n5. Changes in taste and appetite: Some people may experience a decrease in appetite or changes in taste perception while taking metformin. This can result in weight loss or a reduced desire to eat.\\n\\nIt is important to note that not everyone will experience these side effects, and many individuals tolerate metformin well. If you are prescribed metformin and have concerns about potential side effects, it is recommended to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice and monitor your response to the medication.', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)"

This process often starts with data acquisition, where data is gathered from various sources such as databases, sensors, social media, and web scraping. Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.\\n\\nAfter the data is cleaned, data scientists use statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights. Statistical techniques help in understanding the distribution of data, identifying outliers, and testing hypotheses. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, enable the creation of predictive models and classification systems.\\n\\nData scientists also use data visualization techniques to present their findings in a clear and understandable manner. Visualizations such as charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards help stakeholders and decision-makers to grasp complex information and make data-driven decisions.\\n\\nIn addition to analyzing data, data scientists are also responsible for designing and implementing data-driven solutions. This involves developing algorithms, building predictive models, and creating automated systems that can process and analyze large volumes of data in real-time.\\n\\nData science has a wide range of applications across various industries. In finance, data scientists use predictive models to forecast market trends and optimize investment strategies. In healthcare, data scientists analyze patient data to identify patterns and develop personalized treatment plans. In marketing, data scientists use customer data to segment markets, target specific audiences, and optimize advertising campaigns.\\n\\nThe field of data science is constantly evolving, driven by advancements in technology and the increasing availability of data. With the rise of big data and the Internet of Things, the amount of data being generated is growing exponentially. This presents both opportunities and challenges for data scientists, who need to develop new techniques and tools to handle and analyze large and complex data sets.\\n\\nIn conclusion, data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to analyze and interpret data. It involves collecting, cleaning, and organizing data, applying statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, and presenting findings through data visualization. Data science has a wide range of applications and is constantly evolving to meet the challenges of big data and emerging technologies.'"

The human then asks when electricity was invented, and the AI explains that electricity was discovered rather than invented, with Benjamin Franklin's kite experiment in 1752 being a notable contribution. The human then asks about Power BI, and the AI describes it as a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. The human follows up by asking about Tableau, and the AI explains that it is a data visualization and business intelligence software.

The phenomenon of electricity has been known for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Egyptians observing static electricity from rubbing amber or other materials. However, the practical use and understanding of electricity began to develop in the 18th century. Benjamin Franklin's experiments with lightning and his invention of the lightning rod in the mid-1700s contributed to the understanding of electricity. The invention of the electric battery by Alessandro Volta in 1800 and the development of the electric telegraph by Samuel Morse in the 1830s further advanced the practical applications of electricity. The discovery of electromagnetic induction by Michael Faraday in the 1830s and the subsequent development of electric generators and motors in the late 19th century laid the foundation for the widespread use of electricity in various industries and households.\""

In it, Schopenhauer examines a total of thirty-eight methods of defeating one's opponent in a debate. He introduces his essay with the idea that philosophers have concentrated in ample measure on the rules of logic, but have not (especially since the time of Immanuel Kant) engaged with the darker art of the dialectic, of controversy. Whereas the purpose of logic is classically said to be a method of arriving at the truth, dialectic, says Schopenhauer, \"... on the other hand, would treat of the intercourse between two rational beings who, because they are rational, ought to think in common, but who, as soon as they cease to agree like two clocks keeping exactly the same time, create a disputation, or intellectual contest.\"\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Islamic terrorism (also known as Islamist terrorism or radical Islamic terrorism) refers to terrorist acts with religious motivations carried out by fundamentalist militant Islamists and Islamic extremists.Incidents and fatalities from Islamic terrorism have been concentrated in eight Muslim-majority countries (Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria), while four Islamic extremist groups (Islamic State, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda) were responsible for 74% of all deaths from terrorism in 2015. The annual number of fatalities from terrorist attacks grew sharply from 2011 to 2014 when it reached a peak of 33,438, before declining to 13,826 in 2019.Since at least the 1990s, these terrorist incidents have occurred on a global scale, affecting not only Muslim-majority countries in Africa and Asia, but also Russia, Australia, Canada, Israel, India, the United States, China, the Philippines, Thailand, and countries within Europe. Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims, with one study finding 80% of terrorist victims to be Muslims. In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups, state actors and their proxies, and elsewhere by condemnation by prominent Islamic figures. Journalists have also become targets of Islamic terrorism, particularly for the depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, with the Charlie Hebdo shooting being protested by millions in France.\n",
      "Justifications given for attacks on civilians by Islamic extremist groups come from their interpretations of the Quran, the hadith, and sharia law. These include retribution by armed jihad for the perceived injustices of unbelievers against Muslims; the belief that the killing of many self-proclaimed Muslims is required because they have violated Islamic law and are disbelievers (takfir); the overriding necessity of restoring and purifying Islam by establishing sharia law, especially by restoring the Caliphate as a pan-Islamic state (especially ISIS); the glory and heavenly rewards of martyrdom; the supremacy of Islam over all other religions.The use of the phrase \"Islamic terrorism\" is disputed. In Western political speech, it has variously been called \"counter-productive\", \"highly politicized, intellectually contestable\" and \"damaging to community relations\", by those who disapprove of the characterization 'Islamic'.\u001b[0m\n",
